#' Functional time series: dynamic FPCA
#'
#' Implementation of dynamic functional principle component analysis (FDPCA),
#' simulation of FAR and FMA processes and frequency domain tools for funcional data.
#' The package is a wrapper for functionality of the multivariate package \pkg{freqdom}
#' for applying frequency domain on objects from \pkg{fda}.
#' Compared to \pkg{freqdom} multiple new visualization methods are added --
#' adequate only if data has functional structure.
#'
#' \pkg{fda.ts} package allows you to functional time series objects
#' in both time and frequency domains. We implement dynamic functional principal component analysis
#' methods, enabling spectral decomposition of a stationary functional time series into uncorrelated components.
#'
#' Dynamic functional principal component analysis enables estimation of temporal filters which
#' transform a functional time series into a vector time series with uncorrelated components,
#' maximizing the long run variance explained.
#' There are two key differnces between classical PCA and dynamic PCA:
#' * Components returned by the dynamic procedure are uncorrelated in time, i.e. for any \eqn{i \neq j}
#' and \eqn{l \in Z}, \eqn{Y_i(t)} and \eqn{Y_j(t_l)} are uncorrelated,
#' * The mapping maximizes the long run variance, which, in case of stationary functional time series, means
#' that the process reconstructed from and \eqn{d > 0} first dynamic principal components
#' better approximates your functional time series process than the first \eqn{d} classic principal components.
#' 
#' Thanks to the unique structure of functional data, where multivariate components are on the
#' same scale and are directly related to each other, one can visualize properties of the
#' filters and frequency domain tools by presenting 2D kernels.
#'
#' For details, please refer to literature below and to help pages of functions \code{\link{fts.dpca}}
#' for estimating the components, \code{\link{fts.dpca.scores}} for estimating scores and
#' \code{\link{fts.dpca.KLexpansion}} for retrieving the signal from components.
#'
#' Apart from frequency domain techniques for stationary functional time series,
#' \pkg{freqdom} provides a toolset of operators such as a functional spectral density operator
#' (\code{\link{fts.spectral.density}}) as well as simulation of functional time series
#' models \code{\link{fts.rar}}, \code{\link{fts.rma}} generating functional
#' autoregressive and moving average respectively.
#' These functions enable developing new techniques based on the Frequency domain analysis.
