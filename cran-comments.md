This package wraps freqdom package for functional data (using fda package) and
adds functional-data-specific plotting. Since majority of users can
benefit from freqdom package without the functional data part, we created
two packages: freqdom (alroady on CRAN) and freqdom.fda (this submission).

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.1

## R CMD check results
